# This file is here mostly as an example. There is also a group_vars dir and a win_package_src dir
# that I can't check in. The group_vars include these variable settings:
#   ansible_user: chrome-bot
#   ansible_password: <redacted>
#   ansible_port: 5986
#   ansible_connection: winrm
#   ansible_winrm_transport: credssp
#   ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation: ignore
#   win_package_src: /home/chrome-bot/ansible/win_package_src/
#
# Contents of win_package_src are on GCS at gs://skia-buildbots/skolo/win/win_package_src
#
# Example command:
#   ansible-playbook -i win-03-hosts setup-skolo-bot.yml

    # TODO(dogben): Would be nice to use PyWin32 to identify the GPU, then use group_by to run the
    # correct playbook.
