Storing Ignore Rules in Firestore
=================================

We need to store the user-created rules for ignoring certain sets of traces.

Schema
------

We should have one Firestore Collection (i.e. table) for these rules.

	ruleEntry
		# ID will be autogenerated
		CreatedBy  string   # email address
		UpdatedBy  string   # email address
		Expires   time.Time
		Query     string
		Note      string

Indexing
--------

No indexes required.

Usage
-----

We just Add, Update, Delete, and List (all).

Growth Opportunities
-------------------

None projected.
