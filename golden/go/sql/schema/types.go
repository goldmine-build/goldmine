// MD5Hash is a specialized type for an array of bytes representing an MD5Hash. We use MD5 hashes
// a lot because they are a deterministic way to generate primary keys, which allows us to more
// easily cache and deduplicate data when ingesting. Additionally, these hashes are somewhat
// space-efficient (compared to UUIDs) and allow us to not have too big of data when
// cross-referencing other tables.
type MD5Hash [md5.Size]byte

// TraceID and the other related types are declared as byte slices instead of MD5Hash because
// 1) we want to avoid copying around the the array data every time (reminder: in Golang, arrays
//   are passed by value); and
// 2) passing arrays into the pgx driver is a little awkward (it only accepts slices so we would
//   have to turn the arrays into slices before passing in and if we forget, it's a runtime error).
