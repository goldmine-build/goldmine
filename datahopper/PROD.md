If there are Task Scheduler alerts, resolve those first.

Otherwise, you should check the
[logs](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer?project=google.com:skia-buildbots&minLogLevel=500&expandAll=false&resource=logging_log%2Fname%2Fskia-datahopper2&logName=projects%2Fgoogle.com:skia-buildbots%2Flogs%2Fdatahopper)
to try to diagnose what's failing.

to try to diagnose what's failing.
